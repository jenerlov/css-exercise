# 5 CSS | Bootstrap

Pathname: 5-css-bootstrap

The purpose with the exercise is by using various snippets, plugins and themes, the student will be able to understand and edit a website's CSS using Bootstrap. The aim is to test many (or all) of bootstrap's possibilities, partly based on Bootsrap's own html code but also based on creating an own HTML skeleton which then uses Bootstrap.

The group themselves decide what the website is aimed at, but it is recommended to focus on the business world or associations active in the business world. Examples can be various (fictitious) businesses, a trade association, or informative pages about a business concern.

For this exercise, try to use Bootstrap as much as possible and only adjust things like texts, images, icons, fonts, colors, etc (without changinge the Bootstrap core code).

The website should display a sufficiently professional level for best practice on the Internet, in terms of content, layout and code quality.

## Further instructions / inspiration

Make at least four pages to your project, for example, and fill them with relevant content.

- index.html
- products.html
- about.html
- contact.html

Install Bootstrap, or use the link-method.

Now try *at least* the foolowing example to see some of them in context.

| Component | In context |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Card <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/card/> | Album (of cards) <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/examples/album/> |
| Navbar <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/navbar/> | Navbars <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/examples/navbars/> |
| Carousel <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/carousel/> | Carousel <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/examples/carousel-rtl/> |
| Placeholders <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/placeholders/> | Products <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/examples/product/> |

Other cool feature worth checking out

| Feature | Link|
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Pagination | <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/pagination/> |
| Scrollspy | <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/scrollspy/> |
| Jumbotron | <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/examples/jumbotron/> |
| Sidebars | <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/examples/sidebars/> |
| Heroes | <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/examples/heroes/> |

It is recommended to add a componenet of your own choosing from every (!) Bootstrap example <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/>  (see the right menu) to where they seams to fit nice to those pages. Add more pages if thats feels necessary.

You are not allowed to use Bootstrap themes in this course. But you should be aware of them, and feel free to use them in any other future course. Check them out at <https://themes.getbootstrap.com/>

## Additional general instructions

1. This is a group effort, and as such uses github (and Live Share where appropriate).

2. Your repo should include, in addition to all other files
    1. a README.md, where the website/project is described 
    2. a file called logbook.md, a written account of who did what
    3. a .gitignore file

> The entire task mshould be handing in at Omniway, by compressing the root folder (zip/rar). Note that all members of the group each must submit their own copy of the project!
