Pathname: 6-course-submission

The objective of the submission is to create a small but, according to best practice, adequate website, using techniques taught during the course.

Architecture and content must be built around *at least* the following subpages

- index.html
- products.html (including a gallery)
- about.html
- contact.html
- blog.html or news.html

The site must

1. Show code separation according to best practice
2. Use elements and selectors according to best practice
3. Use semantic elements to build the layout
4. include appropriate wireframes (included in a single folder called wireframes), alternatively inserted in an md file included in the project
5. Be responsive
6. Use bootstrap snippets/component.
8. Present overal a sufficiently good layout, exhibit code quality and be free of obvious bugs.
9. Use tests where appropriate.

The site should

10. Take accessibility into account
11. Take search engine optimization (SEO) into account

The group themselves decide what the website is aimed at, but it is recommended to focus on the business world or associations active in the business world. Examples can be various (fictitious) businesses, a trade association, or informative pages about a business concern.

The website must display a sufficiently professional level for best practice on the Internet, in terms of content, layout and code quality.

## Grade G

All pages of the website must be created using wireframes, which are included in a single folder called wireframes, alternatively inserted in an md file included in the project.

The website must be responsive satisfactory enough, use at least five bootstrap snippets and take some accessibility and search engine optimization into account. The page must show code separation according to best practice, use semantic elements and present a sufficiently good layout.

The code must exhibit code quality and be free of obvious bugs. Tests have been used where appropriate.

## Additional general instructions

1. This is a group effort, and as such uses github (and Live Share where appropriate).

2. The teacher must be invited to your repo

3. Your repo must include, in addition to all other files
    - a README.[md], where the website/project is described
    - a file called logbook.[md], a written account of who did what
    - a .gitignore file

4. Each group must also be prepared to present their work to the rest of the class

> The entire task must be handing in at Omniway, by compressing the root folder (zip/rar). Note that all members of the group each must submit their own copy of the project! Any written tasks (except logbook and readme) and submission questions that belong to the task are answered in Omniway.
