# CSS Positioning Group Project

This is a group project with the intention to practice and implement what we learned in our CSS classes, in the topic of positioning CSS elements. It's our first group project, so we will also try our abilities to co-operate using git and github and including documentation of our work using markdown.

## Skills to be tested

- HTML
- CSS
- Wireframe
- Git
- Github

## Execution

1. We will use git and github to clone our teacher's repository and create a separate branch for each of the member to work in.
2. Based on the wireframe provided by the teacher we will use our HTML and CSS skills to create a same looking website.
3. Draw our own lo-fi wireframes and create websites based on those wireframes. Except the Home page created in the previous step based on our teacher's wireframe, we shall create a Product, About and Contact page to complete the assignment.
