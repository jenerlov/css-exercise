# 4 CSS | responsivness, animations and the use of svg

Pathname: 4-css-responsive-anim-svg

The aim of the exercise is to understand the basics of how to create an responsive website. It is also an opportunity to experiment with different animattion tools in CSS like transform, transistion and animation, and also an opportunity to use svg.

From now on, all pages must be responsive, using techniques such as viewport and media queries (@media). In addition, techniques such as grids or flexbox should be used (preferably use flexbox as this is also used by Bootstrap).

The website should *at least* contain the following self descriptive pages, with relevant content.

- index.html
- products.html *or* gallery.html
- about.html
- contact.html
- blog.html *or* news.html

Feel free to use created pages from previous exercises as a starting point. Reference to responsive templates such as w3.css, or frameworks such as Bootstrap should not be used this time.

Make at least two interesting and useful animations, such as modal techniques for images, an animated menu, or similar.

Draw an interesting logo using svg, and insert it in the header of each page, with the use of the element svg, its children and their attributes. <https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_svg.asp>

## Texts and images

Text should always be relevant to the content, but "Lorem ipsum" placeholder text is sufficient, except for for headlines and other places where the context otherwise does not make sense. Images are needed, and can be choosen from <https://www.pexels.com/sv-se/>. It is a good idea to choose images wisely according to what your group plans to do for targeting your site on your course submission.

## Additional general instructions

1. This is a group effort, and as such uses github (and Live Share where appropriate).

2. Your repo should include, in addition to all other files
    - a README.md, where the website/project is described
    - a file called logbook.md, a written account of who did what
    - a .gitignore file

> The entire task mshould be handing in at Omniway, by compressing the root folder (zip/rar). Note that all members of the group each must submit their own copy of the project!
